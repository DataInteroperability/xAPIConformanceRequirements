,Learning Record Provider conformance requirements,"I propose that a Learning Record Provider, to be conformant, should need to do three general categories of things:



1) not mess up speaking the Experience API (basically, no LRS responses during several representative sessions other than 2xx and 404)



2) if it does receive a response outside those ranges, handle it appropriately (there's considerable leeway here, of course, and there'll need to be an LRS proxy that generates these in the testing setup)



3) for Statements it sends, go above and beyond technically-LRS-legal around, for example, URIs -- they shouldn't be nonsense URLs",,,"Defined by spec,Implied by spec,Not in spec,LRP",3,,"Jason Haag Aug 15, 2016

We also need to do a better job on describing xAPI PROFILES, in general. I have more questions than answers. I feel a LRP / Profile testing capability should be researched a bit more before we determine what is exactly required for conformance.



xAPI Profiles can have the following characteristics:



* Documentation on how to use the profile

* IRIs used as part of vocabulary

* Vocabulary Metadata (new vocab guidance suggests all should be marked up and published using RDF / JSON-LD) and returned if IRI requested. Could this be improved to support conformance testing or profile conformance?

* Recipes, for standardized tracking of common activities

* Rules for authentication, security

* Specific launch requirements

* Specific packaging requirements

* Storage requirements using Document API

* Specific sequence of statements or rules (cmi5 uses initialized verb first)

* granularity or aggregation of statements



* What else is missing to make profiles better or standardized? Profile rules expressed in JSON-LD? Perhaps more ways to coerce and improve data other than RDF? JSON Schema? Not sure. I feel this is a potential area of investigation that we need a better handle on.

* JSON-LD can provide the ability for additional mappings from JSON to RDF, providing more semantic meaning of the data.

* JSON-LD allows values to be coerced to a specified type or to be tagged with a language. We think this could also really help out in our efforts to support conformance of the data associated with Learning Activity Providers‰Ûª ‰ÛÏProfiles‰Û but need more research and evidence, and to try applying it to cmi5 or SCORM profiles.

* As Russell has pointed out before, Implementation of JSON-Schema validation libraries is wildly varied in their extent of coverage, so it is almost impossible to be sure that something found valid by one validator will be found valid by another, with any moderately complex schema. JSON-Schema helps zero in interoperability of semantics though.

* The xAPI community has discussed this topic some already here: https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/issues/577 ( https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/issues/577 )



* Which characteristics do we need for consistent conformance testing of profiles & Learning Record Providers? For example, which of the above profile characteristics does cmi5 or scorm profiles have? We don‰Ûªt want to have to build a unique conformance test suite for each profile, or do we? What characteristics are common or required? Which are optional? A Learning Record Provider ‰ÛÏProfile‰Û testing capability would likely only be able to test for those that are required or common across all profiles.

* What are the characteristics of Caliper Metric Profiles for Caliper? Should we adopt some of their practices?",New,,XAPI-I-471
,Include plausible errors in unacceptable values,"A good conformance suite will do more than check minimal examples -- it will check ""plausible errors"" for correct behavior. Plausible errors are ones that would not be surprising for code that properly handles most values to fail to handle. For example, leap seconds in timestamps, values legal elsewhere in the spec aren't allowed where they shouldn't be, spaces at the ends of otherwise-legal values, and so on.



This proposed requirement is to include a wide array of tests covering such cases, to minimize idiosyncratic data loss between conformant implementations.",,,Implied by spec,1,,,New,,XAPI-I-470
,Define conformance through implementable checks,"A lot of good work has been done extracting raw requirements from the spec, but a lot of the requirements in the spec require quite a bit of context to understand, and are often filtered through meta-requirements (for example, that data types be checked by the LRS in certain ways).



That's why I'm proposing that we define conformance through implementable checks: steps that a client can take to verify a particular behavior, written with sufficiently little ambiguity that independent implementations should be testing basically the same thing.



This is particularly important for all the Statement-related requirements -- what those need to be turned into to be usable in a conformance check are forms of Statements that need to be accepted, and forms of Statements that need to be rejected.",,,"Defined by spec,Implied by spec",3,,,New,,XAPI-I-469

,Consistent vocabulary id for xAPI community,"xAPI spec. has only guaranteed data structure interoperability. To guarantee semantic interoperability for xAPI data sent by different systems, there should not be multiple ids for one semantic meaning. There are a lot of considerations in vocab. id, including naming appropriateness, naming structure, id persistence, both human-readable and machine-readable required, and CoP management... these are all documented in ADL's publications as below. It seems to me there is no enough awareness about all these, and people just choose whatever others used (for example, what you get when you google tin can api), or just create their own. Even we spent the efforts to work with ADL (Jason Haag, thanks!!!) for building AcrossX vocab.

I don't feel this impacts LRS conformance testing. It does impact learning analytics quality, querying, and reporting. This more in line with best practices, governance, and improving semantic interoperability in general of xAPI data. This requirement does indicate a challenge we currently have with decentralization of xAPI vocabularies managed by CoPs. I will write up a more detailed response with more explanation. For now, I would categorize this requirement as impacting LRS conformance testing.

Jason Haag Aug 11, 2016.

I wanted to follow up on this thread with more thoughts on this topic of consistent vocabulary IRIs. This issue has started to rear it‰Ûªs ugly head more frequently during the past few years. The question being asked here is ‰ÛÏDoes IRI consistency or duplication impact LRS conformance?‰Û



I don‰Ûªt believe it impacts our immediate conformance requirements or the LRS tests for the conformance test suite. Please voice your perspectives or opinions if you disagree. Besides impacting the potential for semantic interoperability of data used for things like personalized, adaptive learning, I believe a more immediate impact of this issue is on learning analytics (querying, reporting), xAPI adoption, maturity, and standardization of the spec.



The Activity Streams Vocabulary and IRIs are a real problem mostly because nobody from the xAPI community created them. If any community of practice creates a profile with vocabulary identifiers that happen to unknowingly conflict with Activity Streams identifiers then some LRS developers/consultants have stated this causes a ""multiple identities issue.‰Û I'm not sure what this means in detail, but I think it basically means that it makes generating reports and analytics tougher on the LRS or the person writing the queries.



Take a look at these attachments for an example of duplicates: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0BxhK5TH2EspheEM5YXFZaXpfN0E ( https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0BxhK5TH2EspheEM5YXFZaXpfN0E )



We put together two spreadsheets showing duplicate verb IRIs. This problem actually existed long before the ADL vocabulary guidance/practices were published earlier this year. And there are probably many more IRIs out there in the wild that we don't even know about. We conducted a quick comparison of the tincan registry verbs and the verbs published on the ADL vocab server. Which came first? Activity Streams or ADL verbs? The Chicken or the Egg? I‰Ûªm not sure, but there are many conflicts between those verbs alone. Has this conflict been identified previously? Or are people and LRS implementations just handling it in different ways? If so, the fact that they are handling it differently and rejecting some IRIS but not others is a real threat to interoperability, isn‰Ûªt it? If this ‰ÛÏmultiple identities‰Û / IRIs issue is really a problem for reporting then why are there multiple identifiers for several of the Activity Streams IRIs for the exact same ADL verbs (which are pretty much canonical)? Verbs such as: attended, completed, experienced, interacted, satisfied, shared, and terminated are examples of this. These are all ADL verbs duplicated in the Activity Streams vocabulary and both are listed in the TinCan registry.



And also take a look at this document the vocabulary group circulated last October: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wscWLBX_LmM4BOej5MLMaoJsu2aZvMOxjRGLycLoxlU/edit ( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wscWLBX_LmM4BOej5MLMaoJsu2aZvMOxjRGLycLoxlU/edit ) (excellent comments/thoughts from Andrew Downes and others)



Yet another problem with decentralization is that now even authoring tools are allowing people to create their own verb IRIs on-the-fly within their authoring tool, creating more even more potential problems for duplication. If we all start to embrace existing web standards and practices such as publishing our IRIs as Linked Data it would help enable some really cool things such as allowing authoring tool vendors to provide real-time approved/curated list of terms. We‰Ûªve proven this with our vocabulary spec, primer, and research published earlier this year by the vocab working group. While CoPs are starting to apply these practices for vocabulary IRIs, how do we deal with the others?



The core problem is that our vocabulary model and the process of generating IRIs is too decentralized and not heavily curated. Anyone can do whatever they want without a governing process to truly manage and approve it all. The TinCan registry was an early attempt to solve this problem, but there seems to be so much flexibility and widespread adoption of xAPI that it is impossible to enforce using a centralized approach unless it is put directly back into the spec language. How do we check for consistency and quality of IRIs? I could be wrong, but I don‰Ûªt think this can be enforced as a conformance requirement right now. Perhaps there is a way for a Learning Record Provider (LRP) conformance test of some sort that dereferences the IRIs used in statements to help enforce this practice in the future? Anyhow, I digress‰Û_



I believe we need a renewed strategy to centralize all xAPI IRIs. I‰Ûªm not sure if this would present breaking changes to the spec or not. What are your thoughts?



Moving forward I propose we version out all of the existing Activity Streams identifiers as well as any duplicate identifiers, and have the community come to a consensus on ADL or someone else becoming the single authority for xAPI vocabulary identifiers. In fact, there‰Ûªs no reason it couldn‰Ûªt be managed by the community as a GitHub repo with several companies and organizations committing to being a unified ‰ÛÏcommunity authority‰Û for maintaining it. Some tools and processes would need to be put in place for this to work. However, how would something like this impact existing LRS implementations? I‰Ûªm have not built an LRS so it would be good to hear what other LRS implementors/vendors think.



Removing core IRIs from the spec and the general decentralization of IRIs and metadata to CoPs was a good idea at the time, but appears to be causing problems in hindsight. Now we have vendors saying they won't adopt what was in the current spec and are only supporting IRIs of their choosing? I'm afraid our efforts a creating a vocabulary server and publishing tools are going to be futile if we don't first force the community to acknowledge the problem, version the old IRIs to new ones, and accept some type of centralization and formal process around identifier publishing & management moving forward.



It is going to take a serious community commitment and overarching strategy. It‰Ûªs nobody‰Ûªs fault really that this problem exists. The fact is that it is a result of being early adopters of an evolving, quickly adopted brilliant spec. I believe it‰Ûªs a problem that can be solved if we can come to an agreement.

Thanks a lot for Jason's comment which is very thorough on this issue.



I suggest we look back on what we advocate about xAPI and its promise. What does it take to get there really? And we should communicate clearly there are several crucial elements to achieve data interoperability, so what we call ""compliance"" might have level 1, 2, 3., to get to what xAPI promises.



This issue might not impact so called LRS compliance, if we define clearly what ""LRS compliance"" mean - a LRS is only a big data storage, nothing more.(not guarantee data interoperability, and no data analytics)



As from our experience of providing xAPI analytics, it's a cost that we need to do the mapping and translation for vocab.



I agree with Jason:



I believe we need a renewed strategy to centralize all xAPI IRIs. Moving forward I propose we version out all of the existing Activity Streams identifiers as well as any duplicate identifiers, and have the community come to a consensus on ADL or someone else becoming the single authority for xAPI vocabulary identifiers.



ADL is currently still the stewardship of xAPI, so it seems the governance needs to come from ADL. But ADL can distribute/delegate the responsibility to appropriate parties such as CoP.(those really hands on very dirty with the mess and know it well)
